      <p class="center para-default-settings">I am driven and ambitious, passionate about public service and political engagement. I am a senior at Central Noble High School in Albion, IN, and I maintain a GPA of 3.6 on a 4.0 scale. I am set to graduate in June of 2024, and throughout my academic journey, I have excelled in English and history-related coursework.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="center para-default-settings">I have gained valuable experience through internships in office environments. Over the summer of 2023, I interned with the Office of Congressman Jim Banks in Fort Wayne, IN. In this role, I handled constituent interactions, ensuring their concerns are addressed promptly and accurately. I also contributed to the team by organizing outreach messages and assisting with various projects, such as drafting response letters and organizing data. In the summer of 2022, I interned at Atz Law Office in Albion, IN, where I developed an efficient file storage solution and streamlined document creation processes.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="center para-default-settings">Additionally, I hold the position of Chairman of the Noble County Teenage Republicans. In this role, I organize meetings and events to engage and educate young Republican voters in the county. I also served as a Poll Worker during Indiana's 2022 election cycle, ensuring a smooth and correct voting process. My involvement with local organizations even led me to give testimony in front of the Indiana Senate Committee on Education and Career Development, where I shared my experience with the J. Kruse Foundation's career coaching program.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="center para-default-settings">In addition to my extensive experience, I possess a diverse skill set. I excel in research and data compilation. I am proficient in Microsoft Office Suite and have experience with various coding languages, including HTML, CSS, and R. I leverage these skills to process and analyze data, helping both myself and others gain insight into the issues on hand.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="center para-default-settings">With my drive, commitment to public service, and versatile skill set, I am poised to make a meaningful impact in my future endeavors.</p>
